## [Unreleased]

### Features

- **`/mcp` slash command** — reports MCP (Model Context Protocol) server
  status in the interactive TUI instead of returning "Unknown command". Lists
  any MCP servers an installed extension has registered and clarifies that Pi
  does not read standalone MCP config files (`.agents/mcp.json`,
  `.pi/mcp.json`, `~/.pi/agent/mcp.json`). Fixes
  [#112](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/issues/112).

### Bug Fixes

- **Windows `WSAENOTCONN` retry now also fires for TLS errors surfaced through
  non-`Io` variants** — `is_retryable_not_connected_tls` walks the `TlsError`
  source chain in addition to matching the direct `Io` variant, so a "socket
  not connected" (os error 10057) reported via the TLS library is still
  detected and retried with a fresh connection. Hardens
  [#111](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/issues/111) /
  [#106](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/issues/106).

## [v0.1.20] — 2026-06-13 — Tag-only

### Bug Fixes

- **Windows connect retries now survive `WSAENOTCONN` ("Socket is not
  connected")** — the HTTP client retries the TCP connect when Winsock reports
  `WSAENOTCONN`, and the error-classification logic walks the full
  `io::Error::get_ref` source chain so the code is detected even when it is
  wrapped several layers deep. A Winsock remediation hint is surfaced when the
  condition is hit. Fixes [#106](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/issues/106).

### Internal

- Synced `Cargo.lock` to the released `0.1.19` dependency set.

## [v0.1.19] — 2026-06-11 — Tag-only

### Features

- **ACP dynamic configuration** — ACP mode supports `session/set_model` and
  `session/set_config_option`, so clients can switch the active model and tune
  config options mid-session.
  Fixes [#105](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/issues/105).
- **ACP sessions can persist to disk** — `--session-dir` is honored in ACP mode,
  letting ACP-driven sessions be stored and resumed like interactive ones.
  Fixes [#102](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/issues/102).

### Bug Fixes

- **System prompt emits date only (no clock time)** — the system prompt now
  carries a date-only stamp instead of a full timestamp, so the leading prompt
  prefix stays byte-stable within a day and provider KV caches are preserved
  instead of being invalidated on every turn.
  Fixes [#103](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/issues/103).
- **`llamacpp` and `mistral.rs` are treated as keyless local providers** — these
  local OpenAI-compatible backends no longer demand an API key to be selectable.
  Fixes [#104](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/issues/104).
- **Bundled TLS roots + cached connector** — the HTTP client uses bundled webpki
  roots and caches the TLS connector, avoiding slow per-request system trust-store
  parsing (notably the multi-second `SecTrustSettings` stall on macOS arm64).
  Fixes [#101](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/issues/101).
- **Snapshot/override entries honored for native-adapter legacy providers** —
  `models.json` snapshot and `models-override.json` entries are no longer
  silently dropped for native-adapter providers (openai-codex, github-copilot,
  google-gemini-cli, google-antigravity).
  Fixes [#100](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/issues/100).

### Internal

- Upgraded `asupersync` to `0.3.4`, dropping the `=0.3.2` pin (`0.3.3` was
  yanked).
- Pinned `rust-toolchain` to `nightly-2026-02-19` to stop clippy lint drift, and
  the publish workflow now emits the missing-token error on stdout.
- Docs: model examples use the `openai-completions` API id rather than `openai`.

## [v0.1.18] — 2026-06-05 — Release

### Features

- **TUI front-end is feature-gated behind a default-on `tui` feature** — SDK and
  library consumers can now build without compiling the terminal stack by
  disabling the `tui` feature, while default installs are unchanged.
  Fixes [#98](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/issues/98).

### Internal

- The publish workflow fails loudly when `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` is missing, so
  crates.io publishes can no longer be silently skipped.
  Fixes [#99](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/issues/99).
- Formatting and beads export housekeeping.

## [v0.1.17] — 2026-06-04 — Release

### Features

- **Configurable provider-aware HTTP request timeout** — request timeouts are now
  configurable and provider-aware, addressing spurious "Request timed out"
  failures on slow providers.
  Fixes [#90](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/issues/90).
- **Dynamic model fetch with caching** — providers can fetch their live model
  list with a 5-minute TTL cache and a static-registry fallback; the static
  fallback is no longer cached so a transient fetch failure does not pin a stale
  list.

### Bug Fixes

- **GitHub Copilot sign-in works out of the box** — a default Copilot
  `client_id` is shipped and the Copilot device flow is wired into `/login`
  with an SSH/headless fallback, so login no longer requires manual client
  configuration.
  Fixes [#97](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/issues/97).
- **Idle CPU churn from cursor blink removed** — the interactive front-end stops
  the cursor-blink repaint loop while idle so the async runtime can actually
  park.
- **Kimi-for-coding fallbacks modernized** — prefer K2.6/K2.5 over the legacy
  K2-thinking model as concrete fallbacks.

### Internal

- Release binary size budget raised from 20 MB to 25 MB; no-mock CI now gates
  only new violations via a `.no-mock-allowlist` file; fuzz target forced to
  `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` so ASan links against dynamic libc; trimmed 70 more
  stale `ext_conformance` artifact fixtures.

## [v0.1.16] — 2026-05-22 — Release

### Features

- **Configurable tool-iteration cap** — added `--max-tool-iterations <N>` CLI
  flag and `PI_MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS` env var. Both override the historical
  hardcoded default of 50. Clamped to `[1, 1000]`; invalid or zero values
  fall back to 50 with a warning. Without this, long multi-step agentic
  tasks (multi-file refactors, multi-phase spec implementations) were
  forcibly stopped with no graceful handoff.
- **Soft handoff warning at 80% of the iteration cap** — when an agent
  crosses `(max * 4) / 5` tool iterations, the runtime injects a one-shot
  steering message ("Tool-iteration budget at ≥80%; begin graceful
  handoff per spec…") so the agent can self-pace into an
  `incomplete-handoff` envelope rather than being silently killed at the
  cap. Skipped for caps below 5 to avoid noise on tiny ceilings. Pairs
  with `--max-tool-iterations` to make iteration-aware-handoff protocols
  self-enforceable.

### Bug Fixes

- **Coding-plan providers are now selectable by `--provider` alone** —
  selecting a provider that has no models in the registry (the routing-only
  presets such as `zai-coding-plan`, `minimax-coding-plan`, and
  `kimi-for-coding`) previously failed with `No models available for
  provider …`. Such providers now synthesize an ad-hoc model entry from a
  per-provider default, honoring `config.default_model` only when it is
  paired with the same provider via `config.default_provider`.
- **Ad-hoc model entries resolve credentials from stored auth / env** —
  synthesized entries started with no API key, so `model_entry_is_ready`
  reported them as unconfigured even when valid credentials existed. Keys
  are now resolved when the entry is created (the SAP path keeps its own
  resolver), so readiness reflects reality.
- **Provider default model ids modernized** — `zai`/`zai-coding-plan` default
  to `glm-4.7` (was `glm-4.6`), `minimax`/`minimax-cn`/`minimax-coding-plan`
  default to `MiniMax-M2.7` (was `MiniMax-M2.5`), and the Kimi for Coding plan
  uses its stable virtual model id `kimi-for-coding`. The single defaults
  table now also feeds ad-hoc synthesis, eliminating duplication.
- **Active model auto-switches when it loses credentials** — when the selected
  model's credentials disappear mid-session, the interactive front-end switches
  to a still-ready model instead of failing the next turn.
  Fixes [#81](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/issues/81).
- **Actionable hints for host/network-unreachable connect failures** — connect
  errors (host unreachable / network unreachable, e.g. the macOS arm64
  `EHOSTUNREACH` case) now surface a remediation hint instead of a bare OS error.
  Fixes [#88](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/issues/88).

### Internal

- **`asupersync` upgraded to `0.3.2`**, fixing a post-session persistence worker
  that spun at ~500% CPU after a session completed.
  Fixes [#83](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/issues/83).
- **Large QuickJS Node-shim conformance push** — extensive hardening of the
  embedded-runtime Node API shims, especially the global `Buffer` surface
  (encoding/length coercion, integer read/write bounds and validation, base64/hex
  decoding, `ArrayBuffer` sharing/offsets, byte-swap parity, single-byte
  encodings) plus `fs`/`crypto` shim fixes, tighter extension-VFS path scoping and
  hermetic fixtures, and fail-closed handling of non-primary entrypoint load
  errors. Adds the `@mariozechner/pi-ai` completion + model-registry host bridge.
- **Swarm operations + autopilot tooling** — deterministic swarm-replay engine
  and ingestor, `pi doctor` swarm checks (rch warm-target affinity planner,
  conflict predictor, reservation recommendations, affinity-proof gate), an
  autopilot dry-run next-action planner with budget-drift watcher and failure
  action catalog, a completion-audit generator, and a swarm operations runbook.
- Regenerate `rquickjs` bindings at build time on Android/Termux; track
  `scripts/skill-smoke.sh` and the `pi-agent-rust` skill so the installer
  regression harness passes in clean CI checkouts.

## [v0.1.15] — 2026-05-02 — Release

### Bug Fixes

- **Default OpenAI Codex model now prefers GPT-5.5 with xhigh reasoning** —
  startup, setup, and model-candidate resolution prefer `openai-codex/gpt-5.5`
  over older GPT-5.4 defaults, with fuzzy aliases covering GPT-5.5 model names.
- **RPC startup paths no longer accidentally behave like interactive TUI
  sessions** — the `--rpc` shortcut is parsed as an explicit RPC mode, avoids
  incompatible `--print` combinations, and skips interactive-only session-index
  maintenance.
- **Non-interactive exits are deterministic** — the CLI process exits after the
  selected mode returns, avoiding runtime-drop hangs after terminal shutdown.
- **Streaming and tool-call edge cases are fail-closed** — SSE EOF flushing is
  terminal across repeated polls, SIGPIPE trampoline exec failures propagate as
  tool errors, and Bun/Node extension helpers avoid invalid native argument
  shapes.
- **Filesystem and extension tests are confinement-aware** — grep output remains
  relative from symlinked working directories, Bun file-write coverage avoids
  escaping the extension root, and validation tolerates unvendored candidate-pool
  hits without weakening hard gates.
- **Release evidence writers honor off-repo target directories** — performance,
  lifecycle, provider-registry, and scenario harnesses now write artifacts under
  `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` when set, preventing release gates from failing on unwritable
  or missing repository `target/` paths.

### Internal

- Stabilize HTTP, model-registry, model-selector, provider backward-lock,
  non-mock compliance, and perf regression fixtures so the release compile,
  clippy, format, workspace test, and release-build gates run cleanly in the
  high-capacity release workspace.

## [v0.1.14] — 2026-04-28 — Release

### Bug Fixes

- **Slash dropdown Enter accepts highlighted entry** — When the autocomplete
  dropdown is open with a highlighted item (the user pressed Down to navigate
  to a specific entry), Enter now accepts the highlight and runs the selected
  command, matching the dropdown's own footer hint "Enter/Tab accept" and the
  convention used by fzf, vim completion, Slack/IRC slash menus, etc. The
  prior behavior — Enter submits the raw editor contents regardless of the
  highlight — is preserved when no item is highlighted, so users who never
  navigated keep the existing escape-hatch behavior.
  Fixes [#61](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/issues/61).
  Regression tests in
  `src/interactive/tests.rs::enter_accepts_highlighted_autocomplete_item` and
  `enter_submits_when_no_autocomplete_item_highlighted`.

- **File mode bits preserved on session rewrite and tool write** — earlier
  release notes (51b7776d) for write-time mode preservation. Bug fix preserves
  permissions across session rewrites that previously stomped them.

### Features

- **User-overridable model list** — Drop a JSON file at
  `<config_dir>/pi/models-override.json` (or set `PI_MODELS_OVERRIDE` to point
  pi at a path elsewhere) to extend the bundled model snapshot at runtime. The
  override file uses the same shape as the bundled snapshot:

  ```json
  {
    "anthropic": ["claude-opus-4-7"],
    "openrouter": ["anthropic/claude-opus-4-7"]
  }
  ```

  Override entries union with the bundled snapshot (set semantics, deduped).
  Missing/blank/malformed files log a warning and are treated as empty so a
  typo never breaks startup. The model catalog cache fingerprint folds in a
  CRC of the override file so memoized consumers refresh correctly when the
  override changes. Documented in `docs/models.md`. Fixes
  [#60](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/issues/60). This
  obsoletes the recurring one-line PRs that just add new model IDs to the
  bundled snapshot — drop them in your config instead.

- **claude-opus-4-7 in anthropic snapshot** — Anthropic shipped Opus 4.7 on
  2026-04-28; surfaced in `/model` autocomplete. Mirrors PR
  [#59](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/pull/59) (closed in
  favor of independent implementation per project policy).

### Internal

- Refactor the snapshot ↔ override merge into a `merge_provider_model_ids`
  helper for testability.
- Address three nightly clippy lints in `package_manager.rs`,
  `extension_preflight.rs`, and `extensions.rs` that were blocking the
  `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` CI gate.
- (Concurrent agent work also merged this cycle — see git log between
  v0.1.13 and v0.1.14 for the full set, including RPC lifecycle event
  refactors and permission recovery test probes.)

### Known Issues

- Seven pre-existing test failures in `src/app.rs::tests::select_model_*`,
  `src/rpc.rs::tests::auto_compaction_*`, and
  `src/session.rs::tests::test_continue_recent_*` predate this release. Tracked
  in beads `bd-d8v93` for follow-up.

## [v0.1.12] — 2026-04-23 — Release

### Bug Fixes

- **Actually fix Windows build.** v0.1.11 attempted to work around the published
  `sqlmodel-sqlite` 0.2.1 dynamic-link issue by adding `libsqlite3-sys` with
  `bundled-windows` as a top-level direct dep. That attempt failed because
  `sqlmodel-sqlite` 0.2.1 still declared `#[link(name = "sqlite3")]` (dynamic)
  without importing any item from `libsqlite3-sys`, so rustc elided the
  `libsqlite3-sys` rlib and dropped its build-script static-link directives
  before link time — leaving only the dynamic-link directive, which failed with
  `__imp_sqlite3_*: unresolved external symbol` on MSVC. Upgrading to
  `sqlmodel-sqlite` 0.2.2 picks up
  [`50e1aca`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/sqlmodel_rust/commit/50e1aca)
  (always bundle via `libsqlite3-sys` feature `bundled`) and
  [`c8bb7d7`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/sqlmodel_rust/commit/c8bb7d7)
  (pin the rlib with an explicit `#[link(name = "sqlite3", kind = "static")]`),
  which make the static-link directives actually survive into the link step.
  Fixes [#55](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/issues/55).

### Dependencies

- Bump `sqlmodel-sqlite` and `sqlmodel-core` from 0.2.1 to 0.2.2.
- Drop the now-redundant `[target.'cfg(windows)'.dependencies] libsqlite3-sys`
  block and the FreeBSD `libsqlite3-sys` mirror of the same workaround. Both
  are subsumed by `sqlmodel-sqlite` 0.2.2 bundling sqlite on every target.

---

## [v0.1.11] — 2026-04-15 — Release

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix Windows build**: Add `libsqlite3-sys` with `bundled-windows` as a direct
  dependency. The published `sqlmodel-sqlite` crate was missing the
  `[target.'cfg(windows)'.dependencies]` section, causing
  `LINK : fatal error LNK1181: cannot open input file 'sqlite3.lib'` on MSVC.
  Fixes [#48](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/issues/48).
- **Fix Windows compiler warnings**: Suppress platform-conditional unused
  variable/mut warnings in `rpc.rs`, `tools.rs`, `doctor.rs`, and
  `session_store_v2.rs` using targeted `#[cfg_attr(not(unix), ...)]` attributes.

### Dependencies

- Bump `sqlmodel-sqlite` and `sqlmodel-core` from 0.2.0 to 0.2.1.

## [v0.1.4] -- 2026-02-20 -- **Release**

Tag: [`12b2e6e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/commit/12b2e6ed26d63d4ccc5df973216aa0b6870aa492)

Major security hardening release with path traversal prevention, command
obfuscation normalization, OOM guards, and a complete overhaul of the hostcall
scheduler. Also introduces zero-copy OpenAI serialization and multi-source
message fetchers.

### Security

- **Path traversal prevention**: `safe_canonicalize()` handles non-existent paths via logical normalization with symlink-aware ancestor resolution; module resolution enforces scope monotonicity within extension roots ([`d1982f3`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/commit/d1982f36545de4541d8c5195f7198b6865f22808)).
- **Command obfuscation normalization**: new `normalize_command_for_classification()` strips shell obfuscation techniques (`${ifs}`, backslash-escaped whitespace) before dangerous command classification ([`d1982f3`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/commit/d1982f36545de4541d8c5195f7198b6865f22808)).
- **OOM guards**: depth limits on recursive JSON hashing (128), `MAX_MODULE_SOURCE_BYTES` (1 GB), `MAX_JOBS_PER_TICK` (10,000), SSE buffer limits (10 MB total, 100 MB per-event) ([`0e17d52`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/commit/0e17d5260a71028e598618288c0d5e94d3362c6d)).
- **Fast-lane policy enforcement**: extension dispatcher fast-lane now runs capability policy checks before executing hostcalls ([`d1982f3`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/commit/d1982f36545de4541d8c5195f7198b6865f22808)).
- **Atomic file permissions**: auth storage and Anthropic device ID files use `OpenOptions::mode(0o600)` instead of post-hoc `chmod` ([`d1982f3`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/commit/d1982f36545de4541d8c5195f7198b6865f22808)).

### Provider Improvements

- **Zero-copy OpenAI serialization**: request types use lifetime-parameterized borrows instead of owned `String`s ([`f518bb0`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/commit/f518bb07585a027bd52b96702e40ca40fc28105b)).
- **Empty base URL handling**: all `normalize_*_base` functions now return canonical defaults for empty/whitespace input ([`f518bb0`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/commit/f518bb07585a027bd52b96702e40ca40fc28105b)).
- **Gemini/Vertex robustness**: unknown part types (executableCode, etc.) silently skipped; `ThinkingEnd` events emitted for open thinking blocks ([`f518bb0`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/commit/f518bb07585a027bd52b96702e40ca40fc28105b)).

### Agent Loop & RPC

- **Multi-source message fetchers**: steering and follow-up fetchers are now `Vec`-based with additive registration, enabling RPC + extensions to both queue messages ([`355d7e9`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/commit/355d7e9dc5c2db35f309b109dd1a1e6cbdb39408)).
- **Queue bounds**: `MAX_RPC_PENDING_MESSAGES` (128), `MAX_UI_PENDING_REQUESTS` (64) prevent OOM ([`355d7e9`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/commit/355d7e9dc5c2db35f309b109dd1a1e6cbdb39408)).
- **Error persistence fix**: `max_tool_iterations` error now synced to in-memory transcript ([`355d7e9`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/commit/355d7e9dc5c2db35f309b109dd1a1e6cbdb39408)).

### Session Persistence

- **Batched index updates**: group by `sessions_root` for amortized DB access ([`1df017d`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/commit/1df017dbec80dcbc6baa2fed279c7179750343ab)).
- **`RawValue` frames**: session store v2 uses `Box<RawValue>` to avoid re-serializing payloads ([`1df017d`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/commit/1df017dbec80dcbc6baa2fed279c7179750343ab)).
- **Partial hydration tracking**: `v2_message_count_offset` for tail-mode session loading ([`1df017d`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/commit/1df017dbec80dcbc6baa2fed279c7179750343ab)).

### Tools

- **Correct truncation semantics**: trailing newline no longer inflates line count ([`d86e144`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/commit/d86e1440317181869639f87450befeda92371ad6)).
- **DoS guard**: `BASH_FILE_LIMIT_BYTES` (100 MB) prevents unbounded output reads ([`d86e144`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/commit/d86e1440317181869639f87450befeda92371ad6)).

### Hostcall System

- **Log-sinking batch planner**: preserves global request ordering with log-call buffering ([`9792cf6`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/commit/9792cf6fa209d3364ee437e836090e7ee1fa5e1e)).
- **Generation-keyed ghost cache**: `O(log n)` ghost operations replacing `O(n)` `VecDeque` scans ([`9792cf6`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/commit/9792cf6fa209d3364ee437e836090e7ee1fa5e1e)).
- **FIFO scheduler**: `VecDeque` replaces `BinaryHeap` for monotone-sequence macrotask queue ([`9792cf6`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/commit/9792cf6fa209d3364ee437e836090e7ee1fa5e1e)).

### Installer

- Remove auto-hook installation; add idempotent removal of installer-managed hook entries from prior versions ([`d2ffdbb`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/commit/d2ffdbb6d215eefc7b4c2a9a2ca55ba4e7dc557f)).

### Other

- Extension events use camelCase serialization matching TypeScript wire format ([`0e17d52`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/commit/0e17d5260a71028e598618288c0d5e94d3362c6d)).
- Doctor checks for `rg` and `fd`/`fdfind` dependencies ([`0e17d52`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/commit/0e17d5260a71028e598618288c0d5e94d3362c6d)).
- Gist URL parser rejects profile links and non-canonical paths ([`0e17d52`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/commit/0e17d5260a71028e598618288c0d5e94d3362c6d)).

## [v0.1.0] -- 2026-02-17 -- **Tag-only**

Tag: [`f8980ad`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/pi_agent_rust/commit/f8980ad6c92bc5daeeb534d25d7ae0653db19101)

First tagged milestone. The complete from-scratch Rust port of
[Pi Agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi) by Mario Zechner, built on
[asupersync](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/asupersync) and
[rich_rust](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/rich_rust). No GitHub Release
was published for this tag.

### Core Architecture

- Single static binary, no Node/Bun runtime dependency.
- Built on `asupersync` structured concurrency runtime with HTTP/TLS and `Cx`-based capability contexts.
- Terminal UI powered by `rich_rust` (Rust port of Python Rich) with markup syntax, tables, panels, and progress bars.

### Agent & Providers

- Full agent loop with streaming token output, extended thinking support, and conversation branching.
- Anthropic, OpenAI Chat Completions, Azure, Bedrock, Gemini/Vertex, Cohere, Kimi, and Ollama provider implementations.
- Custom SSE parser with UTF-8 tail handling, scanned-byte tracking, and chunk boundary normalization.

### Tools (7 built-in)

- `read` -- file contents and image reading with automatic resizing.
- `write` -- file creation and overwrite.
- `edit` -- surgical string replacement.
- `bash` -- shell command execution with process tree management and timeout.
- `grep` -- content search with context lines.
- `find` -- file discovery by pattern.
- `ls` -- directory listing.
- All tools include automatic truncation (2000 lines / 50 KB) and detailed metadata.

### Session Management

- JSONL-based session persistence with conversation branching and tree visualization.
- Session picker with resume, recent session tracking, and project-scoped sessions.
- Model/thinking level change tracking within sessions.

### Extensions

- QuickJS-based JS/TS extension runtime (no Node or Bun required).
- Native-Rust descriptor runtime for `*.native.json` extensions.
- Node API shims for `fs`, `path`, `os`, `crypto`, `child_process`, `url`, and more.
- Capability-gated hostcall connectors (`tool`/`exec`/`http`/`session`/`ui`/`events`).
- Command-level exec mediation blocking dangerous shell signatures before spawn.
- Trust-state lifecycle (`pending`/`acknowledged`/`trusted`/`killed`) with kill-switch audit logs.
- Hostcall reactor mesh with deterministic shard routing and bounded queue backpressure.
- Sub-100 ms cold load (P95), sub-1 ms warm load (P99).
- 224-entry extension catalog with per-extension conformance status.

### Interactive TUI

- Multi-line text editor with history and scrollable conversation viewport.
- Model selector (`Ctrl+L`), scoped model cycling (`Ctrl+P`/`Ctrl+Shift+P`).
- Session branch navigator (`/tree`).
- Real-time token/cost tracking.
- Context-aware autocomplete for `@` file references and `/` slash commands with fuzzy scoring.
- Login/logout slash commands.

### Three Execution Modes

- **Interactive** (`pi`) -- full TUI with streaming, tools, session branching.
- **Print** (`pi -p "..."`) -- single response to stdout, scriptable.
- **RPC** (`pi --mode rpc`) -- line-delimited JSON protocol for IDE integration.

### Performance Foundation

- Allocation-free hostcall dispatch and zero-copy tool execution.
- Fast-path bypass for io_uring and allocation-free shadow sampling.
- Enum-based session hostcall dispatch replacing string matching.
- Session save hotpath optimization and tree traversal for large sessions.
- NUMA-aware slab pool and replay trace recording to hostcall reactor.
- Extension runtime from QuickJS/JS migrated to native Rust during this cycle.

### CI & Quality

- CI with clippy, rustfmt, test, and benchmark gates.
- Release workflow for Linux (x86_64, aarch64), macOS (x86_64, aarch64), and Windows targets.
- Conformance test suite with 224/224 vendored extension scenarios.
- FrankenNode compatibility test harness for Node.js detection and Bun shim rejection.
- Benchmark comparison reports against legacy TypeScript implementation.

### Installer

- `curl | bash` installer with platform detection, SHA256 verification, and `legacy-pi` alias creation.
- Session migration command and credential pruning.
- Clipboard via `arboard` and Copilot/GitLab OAuth providers.
